Go to this url and link your repo

Complete on the problem on freecodecamp but edit in a git hub repo using
visual studio code, and live server on you home machine. Practice use of
emmet. You should commit at least 15-20 times. I don't want to see a big
block of code pasted in or it will be assumed that you copied it from
some where. The pattern of development should be logicial. I should not
see you having copied your html/css from any external source although
you may certain use the same overall design. Submition both through
github classroom (first) and blackboard. You may copy aftwards into
codepen but I want to see the gradual development in a github repo.
